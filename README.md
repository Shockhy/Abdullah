File Structure:

arduino
Copy
Edit
├── index.html
├── styles.css (optional - internal styles currently embedded)
├── Picture2.jpeg (Hero background image)
├── background1.jpg (Background for multiple sections)
How to Use:

Open index.html in your browser to view the website.

Update image file paths (Picture2.jpeg, background1.jpg) if needed.

Replace or expand the content in the Projects, Skills, and Experience sections to reflect your latest work.

Ensure internet access or local inclusion for icon libraries (e.g., FontAwesome, Devicon).

(Optional) Move inline CSS into styles.css for better organization.

Known Issues / To-Do:

Missing external references for icons (FontAwesome or Devicon).

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic tags).

Add functional backend integration for contact form (currently static).

Consider separating concerns: move styles to CSS file and JS to a .js file.
